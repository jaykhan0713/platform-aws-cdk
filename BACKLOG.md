- apigw and cognito migrated to cdk
- Adot repo and base-images, otel-config.yaml to cdk (research best standard)
- use SSM for 'tools' account (app in this case on same account) exporting resource uri's like service + other images
- enable circuitbreaker rollback: true when ready
- pass in overrideable taskcfgs and settings to service stack while using defaults when empty.
- Automate deletion of CodeArtifact packages (lambda eventbridge)
- create true admin mode on cognito with groups + lambda authorizer
- ratelimiting at gw, api tokens at edge
- Load tests image (k6) ecs spot, adot-collector image, base images etc need portability and automation in cdk
- grafana workspace needs to be made portable.
- add CB automatic state transition to HALF_OPEN in services. Grafana needs CB metrics as well.
- use platform-codebuild-cdk-deploy.ts in place of platform-service-codebuild-deploy.ts
