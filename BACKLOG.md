- apigw and cognito migrated to cdk
- Adot repo and base-images, otel-config.yaml to cdk (research best standard)
- use SSM for 'tools' account (app in this case on same account) exporting resource uri's like service + other images
- update alb to listen on 443, dont terminate TLS on API gw, instead terminate at ALB. Can keep service to service http.
- enable circuitbreaker rollback: true when ready
- pass in overrideable taskcfgs and settings to service stack while using defaults when empty.
- Automate deletion of CodeArtifact packages (lambda eventbridge)
- Move away from SNAPSHOT republishing logic in services
- sleepmode every night (turn down ecs services to 0, vpce's torn down etc)
- seamless way to pull on local from codeartifact without running script first
