- apigw and cognito migrated to cdk
- to simulate ownership boundaries, separate network, cicd, shared (ecr, ecs), services and use exports+imports
- Update non network app.ts like ecs resources to use subnet imports instead of PRIVATE_ISOLATED
- Adot repo and base-images, otel-config.yaml to cdk (research best standard)
- use SSM for 'tools' account (app in this case on same account) exporting resource uri's like service + other images
- vpc link moved from network to edge
